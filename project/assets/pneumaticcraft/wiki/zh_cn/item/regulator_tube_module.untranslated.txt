The Regulator Tube Module is used to limit the pressure going through the tube. The threshold pressure is determined like the [link{item/safety_tube_module}]Safety Valve Tube[link{}], which is by the formula:

[prefix{l}]Redstone strength = 15 - (2 x threshold pressure)[prefix{}]

When this threshold has been reached this tube won't let gasses through anymore. This principal can be used as a 'transformer': On the input there are high pressurized gases. The Regulator Tube limits the pressure on the output to the threshold pressure. This allows a lower tiered network to be powered by a higher one.

[prefix{l}]One-way behaviour[prefix{}]
The Regulator tube will only regulate to one way, namely the direction it's pointing at. To the other side the gases are [prefix{l}]NOT [prefix{}] stopped! This can be used to create a one way valve.

[prefix{l}]Applying an    [link{item/advanced_pcb}]Advanced PCB[link{}][prefix{}]
The Advanced PCB behaviour of the Regulator Tube Module is [prefix{n}]very [prefix{}]similar to that of the [link{item/safety_tube_module}]Safety Valve Module[link{}]. I suggest to go to that linked page for info.
