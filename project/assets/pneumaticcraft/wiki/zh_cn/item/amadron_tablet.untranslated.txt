Amadron 平板电脑时一个在充气后可以用来订购物品和流体的物品。可以在 GUI 中选择并购买订单。要做到这一点，首先要用 Amadron 平板电脑右击一个容器，将其绑定。随后，这个容器将会用于提供所付的物品并存放购买到的物品。对于储罐也是一样的。

GUI 足够智能，可以通过查看容器/储罐获取你可以买什么、可以买多少的信息。下单后，一个无人机将会生成，取走用于付款的物品，在它取走物品，消失后，当它已经取走了用于付款的所有东西后，第二个无人hi将会生成，配送所订购的物品。配送后，其将会离开。

此物品是活的一些平常无法获得的物品的方式，例如 PCB 蓝图以及装配程序。同时，添加一些随机的村民交易。注：村民贸易每天早上都会更新。

[prefix{l}]玩家对玩家的贸易[prefix{}]
By clicking the 'Add trade' button you can offer your own items/fluids to be traded for other items/fluids. In there you can select an item/fluid to sell on the left side of the GUI, and an item/fluid you want to have on the right. Secondly you can set amounts by using the text boxes.

Lastly you need to specify where you want to provide the items/fluids from, and where you want to receive payments from other players. When no such locations are provided, the locations stored in the Amadron Tablet used for normal offers are used.

When all is set, the 'Add trade' button will be clickable. A trade will be added. Players can buy this trade by using the Amadron Tablet just like how they would with normal offers. The difference is that there is no unlimited stock. When you put in items/fluids in the inventory/tank you sell items from, when there's enough, a Drone will come in to pick up these items/fluids. When the Drone has gone, the stock will be increased. This can be seen in the Amadron Tablet.

Other players can now accept the offer up to the amount that is in stock. When a player accepts an offer you'll be notified provided you are online. A drone will come in to deliver you the items/fluids the player has bought your items/fluids with. A trade has been completed.

By sneak-right-clicking your own trade the trade will be removed, and any item/fluid in stock will be tried to be returned to the inventory/tank that provided them. When (partially) unsuccessful, these items/fluids are lost!

Note that the trading system is fully configurable: A maximum amount of trades per player can be set, and all trades (including non-player trades) can be configured via JSON files in the config folder.
