条件拼图是一系列允许你检查某些事情，并且当条件满足时跳转到程序的某一部分的编程拼图。

每一个条件拼图都可以在其靠下的参数槽连接一个文本拼图。当满足条件时，其将在[prefix{o}]右[prefix{}]侧寻找文本拼图，并跳转到以其内容为名的[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/label}]标签[link{}]拼图。当条件[prefix{o}]不[prefix{}]满足时，其将跳转到以其[prefix{o}]左[prefix{}]侧文本拼图的内容为名的标签拼图。当条件拼图找不到文本拼图参数时，将继续处理连接在其下方的拼图。

Most of the time, you can right-click a Condition piece to open a GUI to configure the condition. The GUI will usually contain a '='/'>='/'<=' option, and a text field where you can enter a number. With this you can set up conditions (like item counts in a chest) to be exactly 10 ('=' mode and text field 10), more than 20 ('>=' mode and text field '21') and less than 12 (either '>=' mode and text field '12', and checking for the condition to be false OR '<=' mode and text field '11').

Conditions can be divided into two categories: Conditions and Drone Conditions. Plain Conditions are used to check for things inside the world. You can check if a Chest has a certain amount items, for example. Drone Conditions specifically target the Drone. You can check if a Drone has a certain item, or has a certain pressure, for example.

[prefix{l}]Conditions: [prefix{}]
Most (normal) Conditions have an Any/All block option. This is used when you are checking multiple blocks with one Condition. In 'Any' mode, one of the blocks in the selected area need to match the condition to be true. In 'All' mode, all blocks have to.

The following is a list of all Conditions:
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_item_inventory}]Condition: Items[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_block}]Condition: Block[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_liquid_inventory}]Condition: Liquid[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_redstone}]Condition: Redstone[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_entity}]Condition: Entity[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_pressure}]Condition: Pressure[link{}]
[link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/condition_coordinate}]Condition: Coordinate[link{}]
