空气接口使用高端的科技与玩家之间传输物品。这个玩家被设定为放置空气接口的玩家。然后，施加足够的压力后，这个方块可以被像与其他容器（比如箱子）一样的方法交互。比如，可以用漏斗输入物品。物品并不是输入到这个方块里；其直接被传输到放置该空气接口的玩家的物品栏里。可以通过该方块直接从玩家的物品栏取出/加入物品。例如，通过与空气接口连接的 Applied Energistics 的输出总线，可以保持玩家背包里有 64 根火把。
<译者注：此处疑似笔误，原文为 import bus（输入总线），但此处应当使用输出总线才能提供物品>

所连接的玩家的主物品栏（快捷栏和物品栏）可以通过四个侧面访问，而装甲栏可以通过顶面和底面访问。

[prefix{l}]Water Breathing[prefix{}]
显然，既然我们有用空气供能的可以与玩家连接的机器，就应该可以把这些空气传送给玩家——对吧？At a cost of 200mL/tick (equal to 4 Advanced Air Compressors) the player can breathe indefinitely under water.

[prefix{l}]Interfacing RF[prefix{}]
An Aerial Interface accepts Forge Energy (compatible with RF power). The energy stored in its internal buffer (100,000) is used to charge any chargeable item in the player's inventory (and armor slots).

[prefix{l}]Auto-feeding [prefix{}]
By inserting a Dispenser Upgrade you can make the Aerial Interface act like a remote auto-feeder. Only food items will be accepted through the Aerial Interface, and only when the player is hungry enough to fully utilize the provided meal. Note that when an inventory offers a stack of >1, the Interface waits until the player can consume that amount. To make sure the smallest amount of food can be utilized use slow inserting inventories like [link{block/hopper}]Hoppers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]Experience Handling[prefix{}]
The Dispenser Upgrade also allows you to pump experience fluids from several other mods into or out of the Aerial Interface. When multiple types of liquid XP exist in your instance, you can choose which fluids to use via the Experience tab in the Aerial Interface GUI.  The Experience tab also shows which mods' experience fluids have been detected and are available for use.

Note that the Aerial Interface doesn't have an internal liquid buffer; it uses the player's experience directly as a "tank". This means that when pumping XP in or out, you need a device that can transport liquids at a rate higher than the amount of liquid XP per XP point. This rate is 20mB/tick for all known fluids at the time of writing.

[prefix{l}]Auto-charging [prefix{}]
By pointing a [link{item/charging_module}]Charging Module[link{}] at the Aerial Interface, you can charge any pressurizable items in the player's inventory. Note that to charge any worn armor items (Pneumatic Helmet), the charging module must be pointed at the top or bottom face of the Aerial Interface.

[prefix{l}]Computer Peripheral[prefix{}]
The Aerial Interface can be accessed as a pneumatic peripheral only on the top and bottom of the block. The other sides don't give access to a pneumatic peripheral. This allows you to us mods like OpenPeripherals to access the contents of the player's inventory through the Aerial Interface by connecting to the Aerial Interface from a side.
